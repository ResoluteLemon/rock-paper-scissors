Project Requirements:
- The game is played against a computer.
- Computer randomly chooses between rock, paper, and scissors.
- The game contains a function (eg. playRound) that takes 2 parameters: playerSelection and computerSelection, and return string that declares winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".
- Player input for playerSelection() should be case-insensitive.
- If there is a tie/draw, the round is re-played.
- The main function that plays the round (eg. playRound) should return the results of the function call, not just simply console.log them. 
- Game contains a function called game(), which calls the playRound() function to play a best-of-five game.
- Game keeps the score
- Game reports winner or loser at the end of the rounds.

#Pseudocode First iteration
Variables required:
 - score (number)
 - choices (object, with 3 keys: rock,paper,scissors => corresponding to 3 values of 1, 2, and 3 respectively)
 - computer choice (number: corresponds to one of the choices)
 - player choice (number: corresponds to one of the choices)
 - game state, win/lose (boolean)
 - round state, win/lose/tie (boolean?)
 - number of rounds (number)
 - outcome text feedback (string: report status of round or game - if game over)

Functions required:
 - game()
 - playRound()


Pseudocode for the Game algorithm:
Start the game
Create choices object that has 3 key/value pairs: rock and 0, paper and 1, scissors and 2
Create variable for computer choice
Create variable for player choice
Create variable for score and initiate it to 0 -->

Pseudocode Second Iteration
Function: Play game
    #LOOP
    Function: Update state (creating the initial state)
        - score
        - choices
        - computer choice
        - player choice
        - game win/lose
        - round win/lose/tie
        - number of rounds
    Function: Render state
        - Function: Display selections for both sides
        - Function: Display round outcome
        - Function: Display score
        - Function: Display rounds remaining
        - Function: Display game outcome (win/lose)
            #IF game outcome = win, then #END LOOP
            #ELSE continue loop
    Function: Play round
        Function: Get player selection
        Function: Get computer selection
        Function: Compute outcome
