Project Requirements:
- The game is played against a computer.
- Computer randomly chooses between rock, paper, and scissors.
- The game contains a function (eg. playRound) that takes 2 parameters: playerSelection and computerSelection, and return string that declares winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".
- Player input for playerSelection() should be case-insensitive.
- If there is a tie/draw, the round is re-played.
- The main function that plays the round (eg. playRound) should return the results of the function call, not just simply console.log them. 
- Game contains a function called game(), which calls the playRound() function to play a best-of-five game.
- Game keeps the score
- Game reports winner or loser at the end of the rounds. 

Pseudo Code:

Create choices array = rock, paper, scissors
Create outcomes array = tie, lose, win
Start game
Initialize state
    computer score 0
    player score 0
    round 1
    max rounds 5
Play round
    get computer selection
        get random number and round it to 0, 1, or 2 (corresponds to choices array)
    get player selection
        get input from player
        make it lower case
        Condition check: does it correspond to rock, paper, or scissors?
            If true: record and return it
            If false: alert and request input again
        convert input text into index of 0, 1, or 2 (corresponds to choices array)
    compute round outcome
        get difference of player and computer selection
        Condition check: is it a negative number?
            If true: 
                add 3 to it (so that it fits within sets of 3)
                then mod 3 it
                Condition check: is it 2?
                    If true: player wins round
                    If false: 
                        Condition check: is it 1?
                            If true: computer wins round
                            If false (it is 0): round is a tie 
            If false (it is a positive number):
                mod 3 the difference
                Condition check: is it 2?
                    If true: player wins round
                    If false: 
                        Condition check: is it 1?
                            If true: computer wins round
                            If false (it is 0): round is a tie 

    Condition check: win? 
        If true:
            player score ++
            round ++
            feedback to player: you won the round
            Condition check: round < maxRounds?
                If true:
                    Play round again
                If false:
                    Condition check: player score > computer score?
                        If true:
                            Win game
                                feedback to player: you win the game
                        If false:
                            Lose game
                                feedback to player: you lose the game
        If false:
            Condition check: is it a tie?
                If true:
                    feedback to player: it is a tie
                    Play round again
                If false (player loses):
                    computer score ++
                    round ++
                    feedback to player: you lose the round
                    Condition check: round < maxRounds?
                        If true:
                            Play round again
                        If false:
                            Condition check: player score > computer score?
                                If true:
                                    Win game
                                        feedback to player: you win the game

                                    Lose game
                                        feedback to player: you lose the game
