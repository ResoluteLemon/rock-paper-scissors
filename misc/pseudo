Project Requirements:
- The game is played against a computer.
- Computer randomly chooses between rock, paper, and scissors.
- The game contains a function (eg. playRound) that takes 2 parameters: playerSelection and computerSelection, and return string that declares winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".
- Player input for playerSelection() should be case-insensitive.
- If there is a tie/draw, the round is re-played.
- The main function that plays the round (eg. playRound) should return the results of the function call, not just simply console.log them. 
- Game contains a function called game(), which calls the playRound() function to play a best-of-five game.
- Game keeps the score
- Game reports winner or loser at the end of the rounds.
